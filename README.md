## Description

The primary source of communication is email. Emails are for private or business reasons and for any kind of online registration. Therefore, with the increase of information delivered through emails, spam emails are also delivered. Every person gets, on average, around 20 emails every day.
This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict the presence of spam messages. 
This project uses a dataset containing a list of spam and non-spam emails to train and test the machine-learning models. The models will be evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting if a message is spam. This project is very useful for managing and controlling messages that could jeopardize our privacy and put at risk out personal information. This project will demonstrate the use of different machine learning algorithms and their efficacy in the detection of spam messages. Cyber-attacks through spam messages can be avoided when we have the right model to identify the threat.

## Problem Statement

Spam messages are a way to exploit users and their private information; therefore, identifying spam messages is one of the highest priorities to protect anyone from cyber-attacks through spam messages. This project aims to address this problem by using machine learning to predict if the content of a message is spam. The largest cybersecurity threat to a company is employees. This is attributed to spam emails tricking employees into clicking on malicious links. This project will aim to lessen this threat. Identifying spam and stopping malicious email attacks can be solved using machine learning.

## Proposed Solution
This project will use machine learning algorithms to analyze a large dataset of spam messages. The algorithms will be trained on a subset of the data and then tested on the remaining data to evaluate their accuracy in predicting Spam messages. Since we know that spam is adapting to people becoming more educated on it and how to respond to it, individuals are making it more difficult to identify an email as being spam. This being known, The data sets are current and up-to-date to identify spam that could otherwise be interpreted as legitimate. This project is part of the response to the changing threat landscape.
